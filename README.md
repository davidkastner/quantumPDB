## 1. Overview
The purpose of quantumPDB (qp) is to serve as a toolkit for working with our database of proteins to setup and facilitate DFT-calculation and cluster model creation.

## 2. Installation
Install the package by running the follow commands inside the repository. This will perform a developmental version install. It is good practice to do this inside of a virtual environment. A yaml environmental file has been created to facilitate the installation of dependencies.

### Setup developing environment
To begin working with quantumPDB, first clone the repo and then move into the top-level directory of the package.
Then perform a developer install.
Remember to update your GitHub [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
```bash
git clone git@github.com:davidkastner/quantumPDB.git
```

### Creating python environment
All the dependencies can be loaded together using the prebuilt environment.yml file.
Compatibility is automatically tested for python versions 3.8 and higher.
If you are using MODELLER, you must register for a MODELLER license key
[here](https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html) and set the environment
variable KEY_MODELLER prior to installing the python environment.
If you are only going to be using the package run:
```bash
cd quantumPDB
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate qp
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Command-line interface
All of the functionality of quantumPDB has been organized into a command-line interface (CLI).
After performing the developer install, the CLI can be called from anywhere using `qp`.

## 5. Developer guide

### GitHub refresher
#### Push new changes
Use this Git sequence to make a quick push.

```
git status
git pull
git add -A .
git commit -m "Change a specific functionality"
git push -u origin main
```

#### Making a pull request
Use this Git sequence to make a branch and make a pull request.
Recommend for significant changes.

```
git checkout main
git pull

# Before you begin making changes, create a new branch
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
git add -A
git commit -m "Detailed commit message describing the changes"
git push -u origin new-feature-branch

# Visit github.com to add description, submit, merge the pull request

# Once finished on github.com, return to local
git checkout main
git pull

# Delete the remote branch
git branch -d new-feature-branch
```

#### Handle merge conflict

```
git stash push --include-untracked
git stash drop
git pull
```
## 6. Areas of active development
Currently working on handling all edge cases, including non-canonical amino acids. Additionally, support for mmCIFs will eventually needed to be added to work with newer and larger PDBs. Documentation is present for all functions in the code, but should be added with external examples for use. 

## 7. QuantumPDB generated file structure
An example file structure from a `qp` run given the parameters in `config.yaml` `input: qp_input.csv` and `output_dir: dataset/`.
If we run `qp run -c ./config.yaml`, then the file structure will be generated in `dataset` if `qp_input.csv` specfies `1a9s`.
```
.
